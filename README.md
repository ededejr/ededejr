### hello

welcome to my github. public repositores are projects released as part of my portfolio, or things made available for public use.

### about
most of my time is spent with javascript and typescript, i also spend a fair bit of time with golang. in the last few years ive also been learning rust, a little bit of c++, and refreshing my python.

at work ive predominantly contributed to customer facing products, as well as the foundations and infrastructure to support them. outside of work im limited only by my imagination, some areas ive enjoyed are event driven systems, observability, generative art, command line tooling and writing sdks.
