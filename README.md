### hello

welcome to my github. public repositores are projects released as part of my portfolio, or things made available for public use.

### about
my projects are usually for fun or out of curiousity, rarely with any strategic approach. i think tinkering is a good way to learn. usually you'll find me armed with typescript, golang, rust or python.

at work ive bounced around. mostly ive built customer facing products that are realtime and deal with multimedia. ive also enjoyed working on the foundations and infrastructure to support these products and their codebases.
